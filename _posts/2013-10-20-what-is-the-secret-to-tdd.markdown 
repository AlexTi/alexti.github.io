Hello World,

People come to me all the time, they say to me, "What is the secret to test driven development".

# The first rule is: Trust your tests.
So many young developers are getting so much advice from their parents and from their teachers and from everyone. But what is most important is that you have to dig deep down, dig deep down and ask yourselves, what you want to test not how but what.

And I am not talking about what you co-workers want you to test but you. I talking about figuring out for yourselves what makes your tests solid, no matter how crazy it may sound to other developers.

# Rule number two is: Break the rules
We have so many rules in software development about everything. I say break the rules - not your app, but the rules. It is impossible to be a maverick or a true original if you're over engineering and don't want to break the rules.

My wife has a t-shirt that says, "Over engineered code rarely makes history".

# Rule number three: Don't be afraid to write failing tests.
Anything I have ever coded, I was always willing to write failing tests first. You can't always have passing tests so don't be afraid to break the tests. You can't be paralyzed by fear of failing tests or you will never push more code. You keep pushing because you believe in yourself and in your test suite and you know that it is the right thing to do, and green tests will come. So don't be afraid to break your tests.

# Rule number four: Don't listen to the naysayers.
I mean how many times have you heard that you can't test this and you can't test that and it's never been tested before? Just image if -Arnold Schwarzenegger- had quit when people said it can't be tested.
I hear this all the time. As a matter of fact, I love it when someone says that no one has ever tested this before, because then when I stub it away it that means I am the first one that has stubbed this and people won't mock me no more. So pay no attention to the people that say it can't be tested.


And that brings me to rule number five, which is the most important rule of wor.. of all:
# You never want broken apps because you did not test hard enough.

I never wanted to break my app or introduce a bug because I didn't test hard enough. I always believed leaving no test-case unturned.

Muhammed Ali, one of my great heros, had a great line in the 70's when he was asked "How many tests do you write?" He said, "I don't count my tests. I only start counting when the tests stop failing. When I feel pain, that's when I start counting my tests, because that's when it's really tested."
That's what makes a great test suite.

But remember when you are out there scripting, hacking around, someone at the same time is testing hard.

Someone increases his test coverage and someone is shipping. Just remember that. But if you want to win there is absolutely no way around hard, hard testing.

None of my rules, by the way, of testing, will work unless you do.
I've always figured out that there 8 hours of work day. You need 1 hour to run your tests and have 7 left. Now, I know there are some of you out there that say well, wait a minute, my test suite runs 2 to 4 hours. Well, then, just write your tests to be faster, I would recommend.


# And that takes me to rule number six, which is a very important rule: it's about giving back.
Whatever framework you use for testing, you must always find time to contribute something back to the community. Reaching out and contributing to open source will bring you more satisfaction than anything else you have ever done.

If you out in the world of software development remember this 6 rules.
Trust yourself, Break some rules, Don't be afraid to break a test, Ignore the naysayers, Test like hell, and Give something back.

inspired by Arnold Schwarzeneggers 6 rules of success.
